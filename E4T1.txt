Remediation plan
Securing SSH
    1. To remediate the brute force attacks we can change security groups settings. We can whitelist only the IPs that are trusted. Either company IPs or even personal IPs.
    2. We can remove/disable SSH password login at the server level
    3. We can have all of servers hidden within our VPN and disable all paths to the server except the public HTTP.
Securing S3
    1. To prevent S3 breach we could have done server side encryption with encryption keys being accessible only by key owners.
    2. There is no need for secret recipes to be publicly available. This would not help us if the API credentials were compromised.
    3. We can change the access control list (ACL) for the bucket. That way only certain requestors can have the bucket permissions.
