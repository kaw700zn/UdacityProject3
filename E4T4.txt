1a. We can separate Web Server from Web service. Web server would remain in public subnet and web service (logic) would be moved to private subnet.
1b. We could wrap our infrastructure into VPN and expose only http to the internet.
2.  In my research on VPC endpoints, I found the following: "An endpoint policy does not override or replace IAM user policies or service-specific policies (such as S3 bucket policies). It is a separate policy for controlling access from the endpoint to the specified service." I would say the answer to question 2 is no. Insecure S3 bucket would still be accessible even with VPC private endpoint.
3. No, the default encryption will not encrypt the existing data in S3 bucket.
4. The changes I made were done through the console. If original cloud formation templates were applied over the changed environment, only the specific resources in the cloud formation template would be changed inside of the stack. According to AWS documentation: "AWS CloudFormation compares the changes you submit with the current state of your stack and updates only the changed resources." This means that the security groups would be changed back to open state. However, password change on SSH instance would remain in the same state (we changed password policy to "no").
